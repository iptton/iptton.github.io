Learing dart/fluter. Found some difficulty of learning the developing language:

1. lack of books of the newest version of the language/framework
2. the books for old versions has some thing changed in future can make you confused.

what to do? maybe should pay some attensions to the datetime of articles or books(why not the dart version?cause they usually not in the article)
